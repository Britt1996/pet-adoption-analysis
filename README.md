# Pet Adoption Analysis 

This project analyzes shelter data to uncover patterns in pet adoption outcomes. It uses logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to identify key predictors of successful adoptions.

## Key Findings
- Age and breed are top predictors
- Older animals have lower adoption rates
- Educational efforts and breed-specific outreach can improve outcomes

##  Tools Used
- r 
- Git/GitHub

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: EDA and modeling
- `data/`: Sample datasets (if allowed to share)
- `models/`: Trained model files
