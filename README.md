- Older animals have lower adoption rates
- Educational efforts and breed-specific outreach can improve outcomes

## 💻 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git/GitHub

## 📁 Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: EDA and modeling
- `data/`: Sample datasets (if allowed to share)
- `models/`: Trained model files
