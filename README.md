# Pet Adoption Analysis 🐾

This project analyzes shelter data to uncover patterns in pet adoption outcomes. It uses logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to identify key predictors of successful adoptions.

## 📊 Key Findings
- Age and breed are top predictors
- Older animals have lower adoption rates
- Educational efforts and breed-specific outreach can improve outcomes

## 💻 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git/GitHub

## 📁 Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: EDA and modeling
- `data/`: Sample datasets (if allowed to share)
- `models/`: Trained model files

# 🐾 Pet Adoption Analysis: Uncovering Patterns in Shelter Outcomes

This project analyzes shelter animal intake and outcome data to identify the key factors that influence whether an animal gets adopted. Using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest models, it reveals patterns that can help shelters improve adoption strategies and reduce return rates.

---

## 🧠 Project Summary

Animal shelters face challenges with overcrowding, limited resources, and high return rates. This project explores patterns in adoption outcomes by analyzing structured data on animal characteristics, intake reasons, and movement types.

**Main Goals:**
- Determine which features (age, breed, species, etc.) most influence adoption outcomes
- Predict the likelihood of adoption using machine learning models
- Provide actionable insights for shelters to optimize their adoption processes

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, R (optional)
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Notebook Interface**: Jupyter

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Age** is the most predictive factor: younger animals are adopted more quickly.
- Certain **popular breeds** (like Golden Retrievers or Shih Tzus) are adopted faster, while **stigmatized or large breeds** (like Pit Bulls) experience delays.
- **Return rates** are higher among adopted animals returned within 30 days, especially those brought in for behavior or housing issues.
- A combination of outreach, lifestyle matching, and breed education can improve outcomes.
